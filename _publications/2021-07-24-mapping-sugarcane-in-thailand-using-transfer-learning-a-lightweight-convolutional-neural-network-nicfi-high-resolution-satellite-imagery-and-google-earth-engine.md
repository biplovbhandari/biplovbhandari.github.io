In this study, we used high-resolution satellite imagery from Planet that has been made available to the public through Norwayâ€™s International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI). We tested a U-Net deep-learning algorithm with a lightweight MobileNetV2 network as the encoder branch using the Google Earth Engine computational platform. We trained a model using the RGB channels with a pre-trained network (RGBt), an RGB model with randomly initialized weights (RGBr), and a model with randomly initialized weights including the NIR channel (RGBN).
