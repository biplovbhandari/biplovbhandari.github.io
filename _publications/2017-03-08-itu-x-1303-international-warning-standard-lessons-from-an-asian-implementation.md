The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Standardization Sector recommends implementing the ITU-T X.1303 Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) early warning standard. The Sahana Alerting and Messaging Broker (SAMBRO) software adopts CAP and similar policies and procedures recommended for Mexico by Christian. SAMBRO was operationalized in Myanmar, Maldives, and the Philippines. The strategies for implementing CAP, customizing SAMBRO, and incorporating Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) to meet the individual country requirements, are the primary discussion in this paper. This informative paper presents itself as a case study for CAP Practitioners and Researchers to make use in improving warning interoperability.
