In this paper, we investigate two methods of automatic data labeling: 1. the Joint Research Centre (JRC) surface water maps; 2. an Edge-Otsu dynamic threshold approach. We deployed a U-Net convolutional neural network to map surface water from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and tested the model performance using different hyperparameter tuning combinations to identify the optimal learning rate and loss function. The performance was then evaluated using an independent validation data set.
