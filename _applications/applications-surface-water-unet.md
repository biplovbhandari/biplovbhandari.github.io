title: "Deep learning approach for Sentinel-1 surface water mapping leveraging Google Earth Engine"
excerpt: "We investigate two methods of automatic data labeling: 1. the Joint Research Centre (JRC) surface water maps; 2. an Edge-Otsu dynamic threshold approach. We deployed a U-Net convolutional neural network to map surface water from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and tested the model performance using different hyperparameter tuning combinations to identify the optimal learning rate and loss function.
