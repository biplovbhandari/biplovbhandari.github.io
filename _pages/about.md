Hi and Welcome! I am a computational Earth Scientist applying Data Science and Machine Learning tools to Remote Sensing data. I work as a Geospatial Data Scientist/Researcher for the [NASA SERVIR](https://servirglobal.net/)'s Science Coordination Office (SCO) based in Huntsville, Alabama, US. I co-lead and help facilitate the SCO's cloud, machine learning, and data science capacity. I am also a [Certified TensorFlow Developer](https://www.credential.net/f0b8bd32-b3bd-4bd8-8397-ca1b4b3978b7#gs.aqtiaj), and a registered "A" class Geomatics Engineer with the Nepal Engineering Council.

I have experience consulting for private, non-profit, and government organizations, and have worked with farmers in the field for capacity-building. I have experience in scientific algorithm development, geospatial data processing, machine learning workflows, building and deploying web applications, and software development management. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, running, playing football (soccer), writing, and maintaining [The Geo-ICT Blog](https://thegeoict.com/) and its [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcyJdBQXvJRqxZBWcPU8LkA).
