Hi and Welcome! I am a computational Earth Scientist applying Data Science and Machine Learning tools to Remote Sensing data. 
I am a Graduate Research Assistant for the [NASA SERVIR](https://servirglobal.net/) and an MS candidate in Earth System Science at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. My thesis is "Applying Data Science and Machine Learning Techniques for Hydrological Applications: Case Study in Cambodia." I am developing a data-derived approach to generate rating curves in Cambodia and understanding the usefulness of Machine Learning for bias-correcting the Global Streamflow Prediction system for Cambodia.

I have more than six years of full-time working experience. I have experience consulting for private, non-profit, and government organizations. I have worked with farmers in the field on capacity-building and have mentored several students. I have experience in scientific algorithm development, geospatial data processing, building and deploying web applications, and software development management. I write and maintain [The Geo-ICT Blog](https://thegeoict.com/) in my free time.
