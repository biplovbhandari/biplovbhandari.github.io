Hi and welcome! I'm **Biplov Bhandari**, a Machine Learning Scientist/Engineer with expertise in advanced geospatial analytics and data science. I build cloud-native, scalable solutions that leverage remote sensing data for environmental hazard monitoring, risk assessment, and climate resilience.

My experience spans consulting for private, non-profit, and government organizations, as well as hands-on fieldwork with farmers for capacity-building. Iâ€™m skilled in scientific algorithm development, geospatial data processing, machine learning workflows, web application development, and software project management.

When I'm not busy solving data challenges, I enjoy hiking, running, playing football (soccer), and maintaining [The Geo-ICT YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcyJdBQXvJRqxZBWcPU8LkA).
